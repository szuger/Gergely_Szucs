ver 0.1:
This is my part solution for Home Task 9 WebUI.
I get the html tags from DevTools/Copy XPaths. (this was faster, but not better)
This only adds user name, min and max salary.

ver 0.2 - after the online help, I have a todolist, and done this from it

- parameterize steps: "And I set <minS> minimum salary, <maxS> maximum salary"
- use good xpath(not autogenerated):  changed in AdminPage.cs from auto to manual (other cs contain autogenerated
- redesign Scenario:
  - Given, When section may have several steps
  - Then step should have Verifications: still missing step definitain
- rename Page files: added "Page" where missing  
- lot of things missing...
